Thymeleaf is a Java template engine for processing and creating HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS and text.

In this tutorial, we will discuss how to use Thymeleaf with Spring along with some basic use cases in the view layer of
a Spring MVC application.

The library is extremely extensible, and its natural templating capability ensures we can prototype templates without a
back end. This makes development very fast when compared with other popular template engines such as JSP.
